# capstone-idea
Idea-
The first idea that came to mind is a sort of Yelp clone that is more toward finding different types of food from other places rather than rating and commenting on those places.
One thing that I am interested in trying out is a sort of map of NYC with little images that represent what type of food that place sells mostly.
After the person clicks on them the information for the store popup, the address, the different apps or services that you can use to order from them with links to the store's page on each app, rating, name, etc just general stuff about it.
I also want to implement filters for different restrictions like halal, kosher, vegetarian, etc. As well as food types like Mexican, Asian, sushi, etc.
Under that map that'll maybe take up like the top third or maybe has a whole different section to itself, I want to have a section that shows the top-rated restaurants from each category which can also be changed based on what you want filtered.

Languages/technologies-
I'm guessing CSS, HTML, JS would be the main languages for this website, and an API that helps with finding the different restaurants and the filtering system. The hardest part will probably be the filtering system and displaying the restaurants so anything that helps with that would be beneficial.
